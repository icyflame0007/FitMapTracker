# FitTrack BloodLink

FitTrack BloodLink is an innovative Android application designed to enhance users fitness 
tracking experience by seamlessly integrating it with life-saving blood donation and request 
functionalities. This comprehensive app  determines the user's starting point as their current location and sets the destination point upon finishing the run. Utilizing 
GPS tracking, FitTrack BloodLink monitors users routes 
throughout their runs, capturing essential fitness metrics like distance covered, calories burned, 
average speed, and total duration in real time. The application also has useful health feature 
like calculation of BMI(Body Mass Index) and TDEE(Total Daily Energy Expenditure).
Additionally, users can register as blood donors through the app, making it easier for those 
needing donations. FitTrack BloodLink also includes a map feature displaying nearby blood 
donors, allowing users to view donor details and contact them directly via phone with a single 
click on the marker.
